A new manpower, 'jekim', has arrived at the pretzel restaurant, which is famous as a part-time restaurant in '42Seoul'!!

'jekim', who came to study in the United States, introduced the overseas technologies 'async' and 'await'.

Let's help `jekim` by creating `js` code using `async` / `await`!

- Ex01's pretzel production order, time restrictions, and restrictions in case of failure are the same.
- This time, you must use the `async` / `await` keywords unconditionally.
- The name of each step should be output using `console.log`. (At this time, the **failure content** should also be output.)
- Each task should create a failing case using `reject` or `try / catch` of `Promise`. (In this case, it should be implemented to fail with a probability of `20%` using `Math.random()`.)

> ğŸ’¡ Write code that is more readable than code that only uses Promise objects (Exercise 02)!
