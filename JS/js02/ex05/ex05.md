Creating your own server to practice API server communication is very time consuming, and there is a site where you can easily practice this [Jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)!

In this last exercise, we will use it to practice fetching data from the API.

When you run the program, you need to retrieve 5 random numbers from 1 to 100 and search for posts with them as `id`, and at the same time, you need to search comments, which is the number selected by `postId`.

The order of inquiry should be synchronously in the order of post inquiry -> comments inquiry, but 5 posts should be retrieved asynchronously.

Also, all errors that occur when calling the API must be handled. (The content of the error message is free)

When `npm start` is executed in the CLI environment folder path, the program should be executed, and the displayed format is as follows.

```
Title: (post title)

(body of post)
---
Commented by: (comment's name)
Email: (email in the comment)
(body of comment)
---
Commented by: (comment's name)
Email: (email in the comment)
(body of comment)
---
(skip)
---

(repeat later)
```
