`jaeskim`, studying at `42Seoul`, wanted to buy the same new electronic devices as `sunpark`, so she got a recommendation from `sunpark` and started working part-time at the pretzel house!

`jaeskim` was assigned the same job of making pretzels...!!

However, it must be made using the recently introduced cooking utensil â€˜Promiseâ€™.

Let's help `jaeskim` by creating `js` code using `Promise`!

- Ex01's pretzel production order, time restrictions, and restrictions in case of failure are the same.
- Each operation must be processed through a `Promise` object.
- When each step is successful, `resolve` must be used.
- The name of each step should be output using `console.log`. (At this time, the **failure content** should also be output.)
- Each task should create a failing case using `reject` of `Promise`. (In this case, it should be implemented to fail with a probability of `20%` using `Math.random()`.)
- You cannot use the keywords `async`, `await`, or `try / catch`!
