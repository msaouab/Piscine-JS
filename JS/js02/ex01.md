`sunpark`, who is studying at `42seoul`, recently started looking for a part time job by going around Gaepo market to purchase new electronic devices.

As a result, I got to work part-time at Gaepo Market's famous pretzel house!

`sunpark' was assigned the task of making pretzels. To make pretzels, the following tasks are performed.

This operation will take the following sequence and time.

1. Make the dough - 3 seconds
2. Primary fermentation - 5 seconds
3. Molding - 4.2 seconds
4. Second fermentation - 2 seconds
5. Fry - 5 seconds

Each task fails with a certain probability, and in that case, you have to start over from the task again.

`sunpark` is trying to implement `js` code that can do the above, help `sunpark`!!!!

- Each task should be implemented using `setTimeout` function.

- The name of each step should be output using `console.log`. (At this time, the **failure content** should also be output.)

- Each task should be designed to fail probabilistically by calling the function below each time.

  ```javascript
  function randomFail() {
    if (Math.random() < 0.2) throw "Production failed..!(The salary was cut ã…œã…œ)";
  }
  ```

- You cannot use `Promise`, `<Promise>.then()`, `<Promise>.catch()`, `async`, `await` keywords or functions.
