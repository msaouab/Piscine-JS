You need to create a callback function `callback` as a parameter and a function `setTimer` which takes an interval `interval` in two ways.

The callback function is executed taking a number `count` as a parameter and returns true/false to decide whether to stop or continue `setTimer`. `setTimer` should call the callback function at every interval after receiving input until it is stopped by `callback`.

> ðŸ’¡ Never call `callback` immediately after `setTimer` has run!

`setTimer` passes `count` as a parameter when calling `callback` function, which is incremented by 1 with each call. The initial value is 0.

The working example is as follows.

```javascript
import { setTimer } from './setTimerTimeout.js';

function printNum(count) {
	console.log(count);
	return count < 3;
}

setTimer(printNum, 100); // 0 1 2 3 <= Each output is 100ms apart.
```

You must create a `setTimer` function with the same name and parameters using the two functions `setTimeout` and `setInterval` respectively. Functions using `setTimeout` should be created in `setTimerTimeout.js`, and functions using `setInterval` should be created in `setTimerInterval.js`.
