|   Folder name to submit :     |  ex04                     				|
|   Filename to submit:		      |  exid.js, exid-method-chaining.js |
|   Available external modules: |  doesn't exist    				        |
|   Note :						          |  doesn't exist				          	|

`exid` Create an object that outputs the following output values â€‹â€‹when executed . Implement a function with the following behavior and submit it to exid.js. Also, please reimplement the function with the same function as method chaining and submit it as exid-method-chaining.js.

- exid should have the following properties and methods:
	- count: property to count
	- up: method to increment the count by one
	- down: method to decrease the count by one
	- showCount: method to display the count

> ðŸ’¡ When testing, put the following code in the folder and run it.

```javascript
// exid.js
const exid = {
    count: ...
    up(){
      ...
    },
    down(){
      ...
    },
    showCount(){
      ... 
    },
  };

exid.up();
exid.down();
exid.up();
exid.up();
exid.down();
exid.up();
exid.down();
exid.up();
exid.up();
exid.down();
exid.showCount();
```

```console
> node exid.js | cat -e
42$
```

Use method chaining to make it run like below.
```javascript
const exidMethodChaining = {
    count: ...,
    up(){
      ...
    },
    down(){
      ...
    },
    showCount(){ 
      ...
    },
  };
  
exidMethodChaining.up().down().up().up().down().up().down().up().up().down().showCount()
```
  
```console
> node exid.js | cat -e
42$
```
