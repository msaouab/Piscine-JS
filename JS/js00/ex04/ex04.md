# Exercise 04 - Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down

|               				|                   				|

|   Folder name to submit :     |  ex04                     		|
|   Filename to submit:		    |  exid.js, exid-method-chaining.js |
|   Available external modules: |  doesn't exist    				|
|   Note :						|  doesn't exist				    |

Please create an object called `exid` that prints the following output when executed. Implement the following functions in the `exid.js` file and submit it. Also, re-implement the same function using method chaining and submit it as `exid-method-chaining.js`.

- The `exid` object must have the following properties and methods:
	- count: a property that counts
	- up: a method that increases the count by one
	- down: a method that decreases the count by one
	- showCount: a method that prints the count

> ðŸ’¡ When testing, put the following code in the folder and run it.

```javascript
// exid.js
const exid = {
    count: ...
    up(){
      ...
    },
    down(){
      ...
    },
    showCount(){
      ... 
    },
  };

exid.up();
exid.down();
exid.up();
exid.up();
exid.down();
exid.up();
exid.down();
exid.up();
exid.up();
exid.down();
exid.showCount();
```

```console
> node exid.js | cat -e
42$
```

Use method chaining to make it run like below.

```javascript
const exidMethodChaining = {
    count: ...,
    up(){
      ...
    },
    down(){
      ...
    },
    showCount(){ 
      ...
    },
  };
  
exidMethodChaining.up().down().up().up().down().up().down().up().up().down().showCount()
```
  
```console
> node exid.js | cat -e
42$
```
