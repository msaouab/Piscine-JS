It's time to change! Let's create an object called `dynamicType` that takes in a parameter, stores its value, and outputs it dynamically by converting its type through an external function.

You will end up creating a 'dynamicType' object that works like this!

```javascript
// in dynamicType.js
const dynamicType = {
    ...
    put : ...
    change : ...
    printType : ...
}
```
Please write the following 3 functions: put, change, and printType.
- The put function takes in a parameter of Number type, stores it inside the object and saves it.
- The put function should only be used once before the printType function is executed.
- The change function cast the value received by the put function to the appropriate type based on the string parameter entered.
- The change function must support converting to the following types: String, Number, Object as an Object, Object as an Array.
- How you convert is up to you, but please make sure not to lose the original value received in the put function!

```javascript
type.put(42); // type === Number
type.change(“Array”); // convert to array with the input;
type.printType(); // print the converted value on console;
- [1] // it seems to be good, but where is the 42???
```
- The change function should not work before the put function is used.
- When the printType function is executed, the last converted value should be printed on the console.

```javascript
type.put(42);
...
type.change(“String”);
type.printType();	
- “42”
```
