|   Folder name to submit :     |  ex03             |

It's time to change! Let's create an object dynamicType that receives parameters, stores their values, and outputs them while dynamically converting types through an external function.

You will create a dynamicType object that works like below!
```javascript
// in dynamicType.js
const dynamicType = {
    ...
    put : ...
    change : ...
    printType : ...
}
```

- Write the 3 functions below! : put, change, printType
- put receives a Number type parameter and stores the value put as a parameter inside the object.
- The put function should be used only once for the first time before executing printType.
- The change function uses the value received from the put function to perform type conversion according to the type put as a string in the parameter.
- The change function must support type conversion for the following types. : String, Number, Object as an Object, Object as an Array
- How you cast it is up to you. But please don't lose the first value you received like below!

```javascript
type.put(42); // type === Number
type.change(“Array”); // convert to array with the input;
type.printType(); // print the converted value on console;
- [1] // it seems to be good, but where is the 42???
```
- The change function must not be invoked before using the put function.
- When you run the printType function, the last value cast should be printed to the console.
```javascript
type.put(42);
...
type.change(“String”);
type.printType();
- “42”
```
