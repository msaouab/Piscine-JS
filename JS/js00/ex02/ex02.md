On July 13th, sunpark suddenly gained the ability to time warp when she touched a mysterious marble that fell on the cluster. I made it to experiment with this `time.js`, but unfortunately `time.js`, I did a time warp while writing and the code was not complete. You have `time.js`to help complete the unfinished!

Currently, in sunpark, `time.js` it is written as follows.

```javascript
const month = /* TODO */;
let day = /* TODO */;

const timeWarp = (newMonth, newDay) => {
  // TODO
}
```

When completing the above code, the following conditions must be satisfied.
- Sunpark less code **cannot be modified**. You can only fill in your code in the comments section.
- `month` and `day` should store time information. The first declaration just stores the current date, July 13th.
- You should be able to move time through the timeWarp function. If the time is shifted , the information in `month` and `day` must change.

When evaluating later, we will check whether and has changed `console.log` through and after putting the following code below the code we wrote. `month` `day`

```javascript
timeWarp(5, 10);
timeWarp(11, 20);
```
