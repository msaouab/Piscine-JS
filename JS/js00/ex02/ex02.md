On July 13th, Sunpark found a mysterious ball on a cluster and suddenly gained the ability to time-travel. He wanted to experiment and make a file called `time.js`, but unfortunately, he time-traveled while making it, so he couldn't finish it. You need to help complete the unfinished `time.js`!

Currently, Sunpark's `time.js` file has the following written in it.

```javascript
const month = /* TODO */;
let day = /* TODO */;

const timeWarp = (newMonth, newDay) => {
  // TODO
}
```

When completing the code above, the following conditions must be satisfied:

- Sunpark's existing code cannot be modified. Only the comments section can be filled in with your code.
- The variables `month` and `day` must store time information. Initially, the date should be set to July 13th.
- You should be able to move time through the timeWarp function. If the time is shifted , the information in `month` and `day` must change.

When evaluated, the following code should be placed below the code you wrote, and the `console.log` should be used to check if the `month` and `day` variables have been changed.

```javascript
timeWarp(5, 10);
timeWarp(11, 20);
```
