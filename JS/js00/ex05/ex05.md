Create functions that can use arrays as stacks.

You will use the following function, put that code at the top of the code you want to submit. A function that returns an object containing an array to use as a stack.

```javascript
const stackCreate = () => ({
  arr: []
});
```

The function you need to create is:

- stackEmpty(stack) : A function that checks whether an array in an object (stack) is empty. Returns a Boolean.
- stackPush(stack, data) : A function that adds data to the top of an array in an object (stack). There is no return value.
- stackPeek(stack) : A function that returns the data at the top of an array in an object (stack).
- stackPop(stack) : A function that deletes the data at the top of an array in an object (stack). There is no return value.

Also, if you try to do something on the stack that you can't do (for example, if you run the pop function on an empty stack), you should treat it as an error and throw an exception. Whatever you do, it must work inside the exceptions you define! If an undefined exception is thrown, you will get 0 points!
