Please Create functions that can use an array like a stack.

Use the following functions, and put the code at the top of the code you will submit. The function that returns the object containing the array to be used as a stack.

```javascript
const stackCreate = () => ({
  arr: []
});
```

The functions to be created are as follows:

- stackEmpty(stack) : A function that checks if the array in the object(stack) is empty. Returns Boolean.
- stackPush(stack, data) : A function that adds data to the top of the array in the object(stack). No return value.
- stackPeek(stack) : A function that returns the data at the top of the array in the object(stack).
- stackPop(stack) : A function that removes the data at the top of the array in the object(stack). No return value.

> ðŸ’¡ In this example, you cannot use array functions. If you use them, you will receive 0 points in the evaluation!

Also, if you try to do something that cannot be done in a stack (for example, executing the pop function on an empty stack), handle it as an error and throw an exception. Any operation must work within the exception defined by you! Exceptions not defined will not be tolerated!
