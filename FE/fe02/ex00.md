Create a service that exposes a list of users in your account through the Notion API.

> ðŸ’¡ https://developers.notion.com

- Display **all users** searched based on the Notion API key placed in the project when first connected in a list format.
- The information that must be displayed for each user is as follows.
  - name
  - e-mail
  - User type
  - Profile image (Please indicate the image, not the path)

> ðŸ’¡ You can use the client sdk provided by Notion, but if possible, use axios or fetch to communicate.

> ðŸš¨ In the examples that follow, the API key should not be exposed directly in your code. Find handling of `.env` files in React.
