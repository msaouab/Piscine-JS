# Exercise 03 - State

| | |
| -------------------: | --------------- |
| The folder name to submit: | ex03 |
| File name to submit: | index.html, app.js, index.js, todolistTemplate.js, todolistTemplate.css, input.js, input.css, items.js, items.css, itemlist.js
| External module available: | |
| Note: | |

The file name to be submitted can be changed, removed, or added.

Define the state you need for todolist in App.js and implement the following features.

If the text contents are changed by the user, the state should also change.

When the Add button is clicked, a new state must be created and added.

When the user presses the Enter, it must do the same function as the Add button is clicked.

Add item and test it by checking the state using the React Developer Tools.
