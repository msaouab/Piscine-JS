| The folder name to submit: | ex02 |
| File name to submit: | index.html, src/app.js, index.js, todolistTemplate.js, todolistTemplate.css, input.js, input.css, item.js, item.css, itemlist.js, File |
| External module available: | |
| Note: | |

The file name to be submitted can be changed, removed, or added.

Let's add a component to the todolist template created by EX01.

Enter item and create an input component that can be added.
There must be a section for entering item and a section to enter the Add button.

Press the Add button to create an item component to be added to the item list.
When the mouse goes up to a specific item, the ITEM style changes.
Create a Delete button in each item so that the user can delete a specific item.

Create an itemlist component that shows the added ITEMs and load it from App.js and render it.
ITEMLIST components load and render the ITEM components.

Implement input component to input.js, item component to item.js, and itemlist component to itemlist.js.

All must be implemented as a class component.
