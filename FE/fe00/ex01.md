# Exercise 01 - 컴포넌트

|                              |                    |
| --------------------:        | ------------------ |
|  Folder name to submit :     |  ex01              |
|   File name to be submitted :|  index.html, App.js, index.js, ToDoListTemplate.js, ToDoListTemplate.css, All files required for React Project|
|   External module available : |                 |
|   Note :                      |                 |

The file name to be submitted can be changed, removed, or added.

Let's make the TODOLIST template from the EX00 into a component.

Create a functional component in the new file, TODOLISTTEMPLATE.JS, which is made by the EX00, and call it from App.js.

TodolistTemplate.css is a style sheet for todolistTemplate.js.

This process is a process of creating a todolist frame that does not need to work.

The todolist template must have a section for the user to enter the TODO, and the section where the input TODO appears as a list.
