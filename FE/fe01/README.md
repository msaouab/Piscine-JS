## Basic rules

* Node.js version used by JS PISCINE is LTS 14.x.
* The problems are arranged in difficulty in difficulty.
* Your code is expected to be evaluated through a colleague evaluation, *so please write so that others can read!* (For example, as if the variable name is set meaningfully, or the function name is named according to the function.)
* In the case of implementing a function, the function is imported through the module at the time of evaluation. Therefore, you need to export the function code to be submitted.
  -If one function to be implemented, you must process `Default Export`.
*Nodemon* *Modules* on the same development, such as *ESLINT*, must be defined in 'DevDependencies'.
* Before the evaluation, we install all pre -dependency modules through the `NPM Install` command.
* Unnecessary files such as `Node_modules` must be properly excluded through `.gitignore`.
* We do not evaluate the Code Format, but we recommend that you proceed by checking the Code Format through ESLINT or BEAUTIFY.
* *RTFM !!*
* Sub projects may be changed until 1 hour before the submission deadline.
* If you have found an error (otana logical error) in the problem, please register an issue in [Github repository](https://github.com/issamelferkh/Piscine_JS). With your help, JS PISCINE becomes more perfect :)
