‘🍪Cookie Nara🍪’ is now allowing immigration, not just travel!

Since you have perfectly performed passport-related tasks so far, you have been selected as the person in charge of establishing a new immigration-related system!

Please follow the instructions below to implement it!

### Constraints

- JWT SECRET KEY must not be written raw inside the code.
- You must set expiraton.
- Logic to classify authenticated users should be implemented as middleware.
- There should be no unnecessary and sensitive information in the payload of jwt.
- In the payload of jwt, a value that can be distinguished for the user must be included.
- In the passport-jwt verification logic, the DB object of the user should be injected into `req.user`.
- Token delivery method uses `Bearer Authentication`.
- User's password must be saved as hash value through `bcrypt` module.
- The saltRounds of `bcrypt` must be set to an appropriate value.
- The DB must use MySQL (MariaDB).
- The DB model should have the following structure.
  - ![dbDiagram](./ex03/dbDiagram.png)
- User's name and password must be verified under the following conditions.
  - Only lowercase letters and numbers are allowed for username. 6 or more characters.
  - Password must contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers, respectively, and must be at least 8 characters.
- All primary keys must be operated by auto increment.
- Implement the functions in the API specification below, but don't worry about immigration!
- There should be no unhandled server errors.
