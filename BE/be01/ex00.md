Let's build a database for a small service across subjects. Through ORM! We will use MySQL and Sequelize. You can use MariaDB if you wish.

First, let's create a database. You can use sequelize-cli.

For minimum security, passwords for databases should not be written in source code other than `.env` files. Naturally, you shouldn't submit `.env` files to the GIT repository.

Create a database named `42overflow`. You can refer to the shell contents below.

```shell
$ npx sequelize init

Sequelize CLI [Node: (Node Version), CLI: (CLI Version), ORM: (ORM Version)]

Created "config/config.json"
Successfully created models folder at "<project directory>/models".
Successfully created migrations folder at "<project directory>/migrations".
Successfully created seeders folder at "<project directory>/seeders".

$ npx sequelize db:create

Sequelize CLI [Node: (Node Version), CLI: (CLI Version), ORM: (ORM Version)]

Loaded configuration file "config/config.json".
Using environment "development".
Database 42overflow created.
```

For this subject, the port number is 4242.

When the query executed by Sequelize is output, add a callback to sequelize to output `Database connected successfully.`.

```shell
$ npm start
...
Executing (default): SELECT 1+1 AS result
Database connected successfully.
```
