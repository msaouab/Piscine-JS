You're in charge of the landing page to promote **Express Train Trip with Pug**!

You should implement it using `express` and `pug` and `https://dog.ceo/dog-api/`!

> Please make it prettier so that I want to participate in the â€˜Expressâ€™ train journey with the cute â€˜Pugâ€™! If you decorate it nicely, you get extra points..!! ðŸ˜†

### Requirements

- It should be implemented using only `Pug`.
  - Inline Javascript in html must not be used.
  - wrong example
    ```pug
    script.
        console.log("you can't do that!!!")
    ```

- At the top, it should be possible to move to other pages through the Nav.

- `/` -> main landing page
  - You must have a page with a description of your Pug Express train journey.
  - This should include a random Pug picture obtained through the API.

- `/breeds` -> This page is used to apply for Express travel with animals other than pugs.
  - Varieties called through API should be listed as a list.
  - Also, the listed list must be linked in the form of each `/breeds/:name` .
- `/breeds/:name` -> This is the page where you can apply for the relevant breed and Express travel.
  - Get 10 random images of the dog breed through API and list them on the screen.
