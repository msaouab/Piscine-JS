# Exercise 02 - Handling json files

|                         |                                |
| :---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Folder name to submit: | ex02 |
| File name to be submitted: | All files needed for the project |
| Available external modules: | nodemon, typescript (optional) |
| Note: | None |

Now let's read or append the contents of the file as requested. By referring to the API specification, functions should be implemented using only the http module and the fs module.

You need to set "Content-Type" correctly according to the data type of Body.

If an error occurs, a 500 error is raised and the page displays the error content on the console.

The port number is 4242. When the web server is up, it displays the connection URL in the console.

```
Server running at http://localhost:4242/
```

## API specification

### Get file contents

Get the entire contents of `data.json` located in the root of your project directory. The contents of the file are set to the value of the response's `data` attribute.

If there is no `data.json` file in that location, create it and initialize it with an empty object.

#### Requests

- URL: `http://localhost:4242/file`
- Method: `GET`
- Parameters: None
- Query: None

#### Responses

- Code: `200`
- Content: `JSON` format

  ```json
  {
    "message": "Content retrieved successfully.",
    "data": {
      "1625212375948": "Javascript",
      "1625212385121": "Typescript",
      "1625212390265": "Node.js"
    }
  }
  ```

  If the contents of the file are empty objects, send Plain Text `empty`.

  ```
  empty
  ```

Add new content to `data.json`.

The key-values ​​that are added have the following rules: This content is set to the value of the response's `data` attribute.
