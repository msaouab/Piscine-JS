Voila! Congratulations on your admission. You got a job as a back-end engineer for a good, good, good, small company. On the first day of work, he was given a new project.
"Before we start, why don't we start with our simple social media? What is it? It's a hip style that kids like these days. Is it Redon or Reddit? It's a foreign one, like that."
In a word from the president, the project of the team you entered became a SNS service similar to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/).

"For now, non-members and guests will be blocked from using the service, so I think you should create an account-related API first." I have also received a request.
Whether it's Neckarakuba or FAANG, login is a feature that exists everywhere. Shall we start?

### Requirements

- You must create an account server that supports sign in, sign out, sign up, and password change.
- Create an API for each function and check the response for it. There is no need to implement a separate function corresponding to the area where the frontend works.
- The company's account policy is as follows.
	- Only lowercase letters and numbers are allowed for username. 6 or more characters.
	- Password must contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers, respectively, and must be at least 8 characters.
	- Email required for membership registration.
- When requesting membership, you must validate whether the above policy is followed.
- You must issue a jwt at sign in and cancel the jwt issued at sign out.


### Constraints

- JWT SECRET KEY must not be written raw inside the code.
- When issuing jwt, expiration must be set.
- Inside the payload of jwt, there must be a `username` field.
- There must be a table named 'user' in the DB, and there must be columns 'email', 'password', and 'username'.
- The database within the company uses Mysql. No other options are supported.
- Database handling should only be done through ORM.
- Data at the time of membership registration must be linked to the actual database. It is not permitted to store and handle user data in the form of mockup data only in the code stage without actual DB linkage in any form.
- Saving passwords in raw-data format is prohibited.

### API Specification

Backend engineers don't work alone. Instead, they collaborate with others, including front-end engineers, to build services.
You can't communicate with them by looking at the code one by one. Instead, a well-organized document will take over.
Create a simple document about the api you wrote. If it is difficult to frame the entire document, you can use a service such as [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com).

- Write a simple api document about the request/response details of the apis you created. This is Mandatory.
- The following fields must be specified in the api document to be written.
	- Name and description of the API
	- URL, Method
	- Params, Query, Body (can be omitted if not present)
	- Cookies (can be omitted if none)
	- Status code and message for each response
- You must write all the defined responses provided by the api you write.
